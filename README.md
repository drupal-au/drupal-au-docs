# drupal.org.au project outline

## Background
There has been various discussions and other efforts in the past around a "Drupal AU/NZ" website. 

At Drupalcamp Melbourne 2015 (Nov 27th), there was  a session where details were discussed and a call to action made to create a community-driven project team to make it happen. 
A single page website was built as a placeholder while user research was carried out. Unfortunately not much more was done as resourcing the project is always the difficult part!

A second push came in June 2018 with renewed interest so previous work has been compiled and consolidated. I've created this repository to document the previous work and provide a design brief. 

If anyone feels this information is wrong or could be improved, please create an Issue or submit a Pull Request! I'm certainly not a UX expert and have done this work in lieu of having actual UX resources. That said, it has been reviewed by some of the UXers in our community.

## Objective
Support and promote the Drupal AU/NZ community and eco-system. 

## [User personas](https://github.com/rikki-iki/drupal-au/tree/master/user-personas/README.md)
User research was conducted in 2016 and compiled into these 4 User Personas;
- Drupal business owner
- Drupal developer
- UX professional
- Minority Drupal user

The survey questions used to conduct the research [can be seen here](https://github.com/rikki-iki/drupal-au/tree/master/user-personas/survey-questions.md). 
The survey was anonymous but the results themselves are only shared on a need to know basis. Some information in them is private, and whilst anonymous, some answers can be easy to identify their owner.

## [Features](https://github.com/rikki-iki/drupal-au/tree/master/features/README.md)
From the user personas came the outlines of the sites features and content. The full set of features will be approached from an MVP perspective and may change over time.
Wireframes and design of these features should also be approached from the same MVP perspective. 

## [Design brief](https://github.com/rikki-iki/drupal-au/tree/master/design-brief/README.md)
The next step is Wireframes and some design components. Anyone who is willing and able please contact me!
