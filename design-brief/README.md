# Wireframe and Design brief

## Wireframes

- Ideally some user journeys can be mapped out based on the [features](https://github.com/drupal-org-au/drupal-au-docs/tree/master/features/README.md).
- Non-MVP features can be wireframed later, or included with the understanding that they will developed later (ie. eveything needs to work without them).
- Low-fi wireframes should be enough to give the developers something to start with.

## Design brief

- Must represent both the Autralian and New Zealand Drupal community
- Familiarity with [drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/)'s design elements would be a nice starting point, maybe we can borrow their typography and some global elements like header and footer.
- A new colour palette is needed (I'm thinking black and green but totally open to suggestion)
- Design should focus on a versatile set of styles and components that can be re-used across the different sections, rather than hand crafted pages.
- [A logo](https://github.com/drupal-org-au/drupal-au-docs/tree/master/logo/README.md) is required, but would be managed separately. Some work has already been done and will be added to this repository shortly.
- Ideally some copy can be written for the sections that are not user contributed.
