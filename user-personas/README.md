# User personas

## Drupal Business Owner
More focused on sales, they primarily want Drupal to look professional and impressive to potential clients, and need a place that demonstrates how vast Drupal is in Australia and the range of websites being built with Drupal. Anything that can make the sales pitch easier.

They also like to keep an eye out for potential employees or partnerships with other companies who seem to share their business goals. They attend all the major Drupal events, though they don’t really go to many sessions. They also rarely attend local meetups, but are happy for their staff to help organise them in business hours.

## Proud Drupal Developer
Has been involved in Drupal for close to 10 years and is a long standing member of the community. They work for one of the larger Drupal companies but more often than not are working remotely. They attend local meetups and have spoken at multiple Drupal related conferences. They also travel to the international Drupal Cons every couple of years, taking their family as a mini holiday.

They have a lot of friends in the community and want to keep up to date on the next event (even if it’s not strictly Drupal), either locally or interstate - any excuse to go and hang out with other developers and share ideas is welcome. 

## UX Professional
Whilst a UXer (and this is anyone from User research, Content Strategy to Visual Design) has some understanding of technical details they don’t consider themselves a technical person. They prefer working with Drupal because of it’s flexibility and UX enabling features, but are not exclusive, and generally don’t just work with one organisation. They don’t believe in locking themselves into a platform - the right tool for the right job.

But they have made more than a few friends in the Drupal community and enjoy the casual, light hearted nature of it. They enjoy being a UX advocate to other Drupal companies and hope to get some additional work out of it. Being non-technical they feel like they are on the edges a little bit, and find most of the content in Drupal events boring. They most often attend/speak at non Drupal events. They are more interested in what innovative projects are being built with Drupal and keeping up to date with what Drupal is, and what it’s strengths are.

## Minority Drupal user
This one’s a little broad. They belong to a minority group of the community. They might not speak english well, come from a different background or a different gender than what makes up the majority of the community. Assumptions get made about them that are not always accurate.

But they love Drupal, even if it’s only new to them, they are very excited about it’s potential. They’d like to be more involved in the community, even if it is to prove to themselves that they can be a valuable contributor to it - but they’d feel better if they could find other people in the same boat, so they see getting to know the different groups that make up the Australian Drupal community as their best chance to joining in.
